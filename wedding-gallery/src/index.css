    * *Note:* You also need to ensure Tailwind is set up. If you used the Vite command above, you might need to run `npx tailwindcss init -p` and configure `tailwind.config.js` to look at your files:
```javascript
export default {
  content: [
    "./index.html",
    "./src/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx}",
  ],
  theme: { extend: {} },
  plugins: [],
}
